# LightsOut-Rust-Plugin-Oxide
Turns all Lights out at night then allows user to turn them back on again. 
This is usfull to save on CPU but was designed for servers that run fast gathering (1000x), 
it allows users to see who is home at night becuase normally the lights will run 24/7 due to the high resource rate.

Now if votenight fails the only lights that will be on are for players that are home.
